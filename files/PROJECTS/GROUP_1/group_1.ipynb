    "\n",
    "What genetic variants are associated with the presence of Alzheimers disease, and what variants are protective against Alzheimers disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of APOE\\*4 would be present more often in patients who have developed Alzheimers, as opposed to those with APOE*2 which would serve as a protective barrier against the disease\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comment\n",
    "\n",
    "You are investigating the association of two *APOE* alleles with Alzheimer's disease. \n",
    "This could be accomplished with a simulated cross-sectional study. \n",

    "## Dataset Provided\n",
    "\n",
    "For your research question, I have provided a *simulated* dataset of 10,000 subjects. \n",
    "Some of those subjects have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and some do not (controls). \n",
    "All patients have been genotyped for *APOE* \\*4 and \\*2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset contains the following data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- ID: A number to identify the subject within the dataset\n",
    "- Sex: The subject's sex assigned at birth\n",
    "- Age: The subject's age at the time of data collection. \n",
    "- Alzheimer's: A binary variable indicating whether the subject has a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease\n",
    "    - 0 = No\n",
    "    - 1 = Yes\n",
    "- Presence of APOE\\*4: A binary variable indicating whether the subject has at least one copy of the APOE\\*4 allele\n",
    "    - 0 = No\n",
    "    - 1 = Yes\n",
    "- Presence of APOE\\*2: A binary variable indicating whether the subject has at least one copy of the APOE\\*2 allele\n",
    "    - 0 = No\n",

    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to investigate the association of APOE\\*4 and APOE\\*2 with Alzheimer's disease using the provided dataset. \n",
