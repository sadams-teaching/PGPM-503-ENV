    "If routine testing of CYP2C9 is performed prior to Warfarin initiation (dosing) then we will see a reduced risk of adverse events related to anticoagulation.\n",

    "## Dataset Provided\n",
    "\n",
    "For your research question, I have simulated a dataset with 10,000 patients who received warfarin.\n",
    "Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard-of-care warfarin dosing or PGx-guided warfarin dosing.\n",
    "For patients receiving PGx-guided warfarin dosing, the *CYP2C9* genotype was used to determine the initial dose of warfarin. \n",
    "The genotypes tested were \\*2 and \\*3 (*hint* you should comment on whether or not this is a good enough test for *CYP2C9*).\n",

    "\n",
    "- ID: A number to identify the subject within the dataset\n",
    "- Sex: The subject's sex assigned at birth\n",
    "- Age: The subject's age at the time of data collection\n",
    "- PGx Testing: Whether or not the subject received PGx-guided warfarin dosing\n",
    "    - 0: Standard-of-care warfarin dosing\n",
    "    - 1: PGx-guided warfarin dosing\n",
    "- Test Result: The *CYP2C9* diplotype for the patient. NA == not tested\n",
    "- Bleeding Event: Whether or not the patient experienced a bleeding event\n",
    "    - 0: No bleeding event\n",
    "    - 1: Bleeding event\n",
    "- Treatment Failure: Whether or not the patient experienced a treatment failure\n",
    "    - 0: No treatment failure\n",
    "    - 1: Treatment failure\n",
